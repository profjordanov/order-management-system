SDG 4: Quality Education
_____________________________

Why I care about his theme?
As a PhD student and assistant professor, I devote a significant amount of time to university and the learning process.
I believe that we can use new technologies to create innovative ways to improve education at all levels.

What problems Have I found?
I've noticed that kids nowadays spend as little time as possible reading in order to get to the computer, game console, or smart phone.Â 

What connections/people do I know?
My 10-year-old nephew and his friends or co-students could share their experience.
My university has a lot of connections with schools or can create a custom survey for education centers around.

What ideas do I have?
My plan is to build a metaverse-like educational system powered by VR, a motion controller, digital reality, and other technologies that, for example, will transport students
to different parts of the world in geography classes, will recreate activities and objects for the language classes, and will build geometric figures and many more.
